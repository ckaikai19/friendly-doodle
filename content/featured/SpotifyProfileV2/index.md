A full-stack personal project made to explore the use of mobile-first technology. This app is a hybrid between Pinterest and Instagram and allows users the ability to upload pictures thanks to the use of a javascript library called Multer. The pictures are then stored in AWS S3 Bucket, which is then received on the React Native frontend to later be displayed.
